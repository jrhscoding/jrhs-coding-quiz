This weeks homework was to create a quiz utilizing dynamically created elements as well as storing data.
I found this week to be extremely challenging. Anything from creating the elements, to actually getting them to display
properly.
The timer functionallity caused a bit of a headache as well but regardless this weeks homework was very beneficial
as I feel I learned an incredible amount.

My project is a quiz consisting of 3 multiple choice questions. 
If you answer a question correctly, then you get a + score adjustment of 5.
Answer one incorrectly and you get 5 seconds removed from the timer.
At the end of the quiz you will be asked to enter your initials. 
If you have the highest score in local storage you will replace the highest score in local storage.
If you get a lower score, you receive a message that you do not have the highest score.

Although it may not be the prettiest, I am very proud of this homework. 

The criteria was as follows

GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and score
